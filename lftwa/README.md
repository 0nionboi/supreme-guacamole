### Introduction
Linux for the Windows Administrator is written for Windows Administrators with little-to-no linux experience.  Consider this a quick-and-dirty cheatsheet to help keep those pesky linux servers running.

GNU/Linux can be beautifully simple, or overwhelmingly complex.  This guide focuses on keeping it simple.  Once you get your feet wet, I highly recommend finding a good linux book or course and diving in.  Use this cheatsheet to help you keep your linux servers running in the meantime.
