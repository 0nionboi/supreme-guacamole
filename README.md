# supreme-guacamole
A github repository of my DevOps roadmap.

## atbswp
This folder holds anything I worked on while working through Automate the Boring Stuff With Python.

I recommend creating a virtual environment using venv, and you can install the dependencies for the book with requirements.txt

```
# Creating the virtual environment.
python3 -m venv path/to/virtual/environment
# Activate the virtual environment
source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate

# Install dependencies - run from the atbswp folder, where the requirements.txt is located.
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# After this you can run 'pip3 list' to make sure you have the dependencies installed.
```
## lftwa
This folder holds the markdown file for "Linux for the Windows Administrator" - a cheatsheet I am writing aimed at helping windows administrators with little-to-no linux experience.

## lpthw
Holds my work from the book "Learn Python the Hard Way".  Includes requirements.txt for the virtual environment I used.

## python-scripts
Holds a series of miscellaneous python scripts that I've worked on.  Refer to the documentation in each folder.
- ipParse.py - takes a file with a list of IPs and ports, and parses them into seperate files for use with nmap.

## regex
Holds my work from a python regex workbook.
