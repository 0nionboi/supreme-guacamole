# supreme-guacamole
A github repository of my DevOps roadmap.

## atbswp
This folder holds anything I worked on while working through Automate the Boring Stuff With Python.

I recommend creating a virtual environment using venv, and you can install the dependencies for the book with requirements.txt

```
# Creating the virtual environment.
python3 -m venv path/to/virtual/environment
# Activate the virtual environment
source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate

# Install dependencies - run from the atbswp folder, where the requirements.txt is located.
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# After this you can run 'pip3 list' to make sure you have the dependencies installed.
```
